# SolRise

SolRise is a mini-project within the Sol system that aims to invigorate and motivate sleepy primates with its unique AI-driven wake-up sequence. As the day begins, SolRise starts with gentle reminders, humorous banter, and encouragement to inspire a lively and energetic start. However, as the simian's reluctance persists, SolRise's tone gradually becomes blunter and more sarcastic, offering hilarious yet compelling wake-up calls.
